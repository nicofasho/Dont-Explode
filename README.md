# Avoid the Spoilers 2019 Version McBoogaloo - Or Minesweeper

## Getting Started

You can find the game [here](nicofasho.github.io/Dont-Explode)

The Goal of Avoid the Spoilers is to uncover all the squares without bombs. If you uncover a bomb, you instantly lose. Your first click is always safe. If a clicked square is blank, then there are 0 bombs in the 8 squares neighboring said square. If a clicked square has a number on it, then that is an indication of how many bombs there are around said square. Use logic to narrow down where the bombs are so you can navigate around them. You can also right click to toggle between a flag (usually used to denote a square that you are certain contains a bomb) or a question mark (used to denote a square you are suspicious of but not certain is dangerous). Even if you right click a bomb, it will not go off, so right click away!
